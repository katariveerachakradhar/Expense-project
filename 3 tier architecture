A 3-tier architecture divides an application into three distinct layers: 
the presentation tier (user interface), the application tier (business logic), and the data tier (data storage and retrieval). 
This architecture promotes modularity, maintainability, scalability, and flexibility in software development. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of each tier:

1. Presentation Tier:
----------------------
This tier focuses on the user interface and how it interacts with users. 
It handles displaying information and gathering user input. 

Examples: Web pages, mobile apps, desktop applications. 

2. Application Tier:
---------------------
This tier contains the core business logic of the application. 
It processes data, implements business rules, and coordinates interactions between the presentation and data tiers. 
Examples: APIs, services, controllers.

3. Data Tier:
--------------
This tier is responsible for storing and managing application data. 
It includes the database or file system where data is stored, as well as the data access layer (DAL) that interacts with the database. 
Examples: Databases, file systems, data access objects.
